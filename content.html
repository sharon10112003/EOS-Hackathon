            <p>When she first saw the streetlamp, it seemed to strain only a little against the dark — a brief, polite revolt. That was before she learned how to listen to light as if it were a language; before she could hear the way the lamp hesitated between sentences and then finally disclosed the shape of a certainty.</p>

            <p>They had been told, as children, that nights were for secrets. Adults had a different vocabulary: nights were for forgetting. She, however, came to think of nights as careful curators of small truths, each revealed like an inklet on a white sheet. She kept a small notebook of these, folding the pages at the corners like a person counting days.</p>

            <p>On some evenings the city would give her an easy hour: a stretch of pavement, a passerby humming to themselves, the low, patient hum of the tram. Other nights it supplied only a handful of notes, sharp and dissonant, like a piano string that had been struck and then forgotten. She catalogued the nights in both senses: she composed and she stored.</p>

            <p>When rain began, it was never urgent. Rain moved through the city like a translator, washing away the grammar of everything that had been said before. Footsteps softened, voices offered fewer promises. The rain taught her a new patience: that stories can be rewritten not by erasing lines, but by altering emphasis.</p>

            <p>The end of the story was not dramatic. It arrived as a small clarification — a name remembered, a difficulty resolved with no fanfare. She closed the notebook, folded the corner of the last page, and slipped it into her coat; the city quieted, as if content that once again something human had been observed.</p>
